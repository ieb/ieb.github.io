<p>Although the Test Harness is great and enables Unit tests to work for  components, there is a 'dirty hackers' alternative.</p>
<p>Write a class that operates as a unit test, inject it into Spring, start  the test in the init method, and call you pack project  0000-sakai-myproject-pack</p>
<p>Your project will load first and then execute your unit test, pulling in  all the necessary dependencies. It may not have the full JUnit  environment, but it will test your code.</p>
<p>Just remember to turn the test bean off in production :)</p>
