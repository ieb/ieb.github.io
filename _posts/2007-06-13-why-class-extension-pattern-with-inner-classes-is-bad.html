<p>I'm not against class extension patterns, most of Java is based on it  and makes sense, but when you have a class extension model, coupled with  inner classes and interfaces, the programmer can express all sorts of  bad behavior.</p>
<p>Take the instance where there is a class,A that extends a class,B that  extends a class,C. Class C is the generic impl, Class B is the specific  and Class A is the heavily bound to say a DB.</p>
<p>Once class B contains inner classes and interfaces, instanced in B and  bound to in A, you cant easily extend the classes and inner interfaces in B.</p>
<p>And if the behavior in A (the last in the extension model) overrides the  behavior in B, and B adds functionality, you have to constantly search A  to check that you don't need to override as well.</p>
<p>Finally, inner classes tempt you into binding to properties of the  parent, binding the inner instance forever inside the parent class.</p>
<p>Small inner classes are probably Ok, but big ones with a tangled web of  connections are a pain to work with.</p>
<p>IMHO (having just pulled one of these webs apart to make it compatible  with IOC)</p>
