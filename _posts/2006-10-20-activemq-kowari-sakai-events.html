<p>For some time, I've been thinking about how the Sakai Events which can  fill up a production database should be managed. Although of interest in  the Sakai database they are not necessarily needed for the smooth  running of a Sakai database, and when there are 10 - 20M events present,  the event service slows down a little on insert.</p>
<p>So, I've been playing with ActiveMQ and JMS. at  https://source.sakaiproject.org/contrib/tfd/trunk/eventserver I've put  together a prototype JMS adapter that channels Sakai Events into a local  JMS broker, which then, via a bridge propagates the event to a hub  Broker. This hub broker of which there would be one or more per Sakai  cluster takes the feeds of messages and further distributes them.</p>
<p>One such listener on the Hub might be a JMS to RDF converter that will  take the JMS serialization of the Sakai Event convert it into Triples  and push it into a Kowari instance.</p>
<p>Another use of the hub could be AJAX based real time monitoring of the  event feed for NOC type operations.</p>
<p>A side effect of this loose binding, is that JMS Consumers can exist a  loose bound components, and so can use GPL jars without causing problems  for the main Sakai code base, but then they cant be distributed as part of Sakai... so its all a bit moot.</p>
