<p>Looks like Alfresco is starting to pursue JSR-170 for its 1.2 release.  The positive side is it clusters, the negative side is that at the  moment it doesn't pass all the Level 2 170 tests. I could be plugged in  under the new CHS service with a small adapter, but, if its not solid  through the JSR-170 API, then it will be a pain to run, even in a cluster.</p>
<p>One to watch and put under the Content Hosting Service when its ready,  if Jackrabbit doesn't get there first.</p>
