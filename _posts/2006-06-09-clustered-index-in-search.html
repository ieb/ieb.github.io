<p>After spending many hours with a hot CPU, I finally came up with and  efficient mechanism of indexing in real time in a database clustered  environment. I could have put the Lucene Index segments directly into  the database with a JDBCDirectory from the Compass Framework. But  unfortunately the MySQL configuration of Sakai prohibited the emulation  of seeks within BLOBs, so the performance was hopeless. Im not convinced  that emulating seeks in BLOBS actually helps as I think the entire BLOB  might still be streamed to the App server from the database.</p>
<p>Normally you would run Lucene using Nutch Distributed File System, which  borrows some concepts the the Google File System. NDFS is a self healing    shared nothing file system tuned for use with Lucene.... but its not  easy to set up from within a Java app, and it has to have some dedicated  nodes, dedicated to certain tasks.</p>
<p>Failing that you might run rsync at the end of each index cycle to sync  the Index onto the cluster nodes. I think this was the preferred method  prior to NDFS. However, its a bit difficult to get to EXT3 inodes from  within a Java app, and Sakai runs on Windows and Unix, so I cant rely on  the native rsync command.</p>
<p>The solution that has just gone out to the QA community, was to use the  local FSDirectory to manage local copies of the index segments, and once  an index write cycle is complete, distribute the modified segments via  the database. In testing, I tried this against MySQL with about 10GB of  data in 200-300 K documents. It worked Ok. I'm waiting with baited  breath to see how many JIRA items as posted against this, as everything  that flows over the Sakai Entity bus is seen by the indexer. Nice not to  have a component that just gets tested whatever is done in QA!</p>
