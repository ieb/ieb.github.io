<p>For those who dont know JSR-170 is the Java Content Repository  specification. Apache has recently released a 1.0 implementation with  Jackrabbit, which looks good. Day Software who formed a large part of  that project are using something similar in commercial products that  they sell. If you believe their web site (no reason not to) they have  some solid names as customers.</p>
<p>For those who don't know, Sakai has a Content Hosting Service, that uses  a proprietary implementation that has survived and been improved from  the Chef days.</p>
<p>Having done a bit of work in Content Hosting already, producing a plugin  mechanism as a patch in Sakai 2.1.2 and 2.2, I feel that it has some  shortcomings. These observations are not a criticism as it does what is  does very well. But I feel that there are some aspects of the  implementation that get in the way. For instance, Collections and  Resources are separated objects. The storage of objects or nodes within  the content hierarchy is done in such a way as to make extension  difficult. I have a feeling that the data access patterns are causing  performance problems with WebDAV.</p>
<p>Rather than whine about it to the community, I've decided to have a go  at using a JCR under the ContentHostingServce to re-implement this  service. If it works it might mike life easier.</p>
<p>Jackrabbit performance looks good and the storage architecture matches  what is implemented in Sakai so should work in a cluster. The intention  is to use the Jackrabbit WebDAV, and inject the Sakai security model at  the service level. The JCR will become akin to an RDBMS, where a back  end users acts on behalf of a role in the front end.</p>
