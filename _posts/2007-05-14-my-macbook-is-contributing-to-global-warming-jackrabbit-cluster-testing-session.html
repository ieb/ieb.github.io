<p>Only by a few watts, testing Jackrabbit in a cluster. I have been  testing a 2 node cluster of Sakai with JCRService with 2 data sets. Once  it lots of small files, 9,215 files in 178Mb, some indexable, and the  other 100 or so files of mixed type for 315MB. The single node cluster  (ie no cluster) works seamlessly, uploading 4 files/second for the  smaller files and growing the heap by about 100M every 2 minutes, which  gets GC's back down to a baseline of about 160M, probably about 1M per  request. Looking at the CPU time, most time appears to be spent syncing  the data down to the DB, which is good, indicating that the JCR is  running as fast as the DB can accept data.</p>
<p>I am running with standard Jackrabbit 1.3 persistence managers and cache  journal with everything going to the DB. (well standard apart from a bug  I fixed in the journal code) Each node has its own repository home.</p>
<p>Of the larger dataset, I have uploaded this several times and copied it  within the JCR using webdav several times so there is at least 1G of  content.</p>
<p>This isn't exactly a full test, but its a start and indicates that  Jackrabbit 1.3, using pure DB persistence for Version, Bodies and nodes  (using the SimpleDbPersistance) works well in a cluster.</p>
<p>I also tried the File Journal, but found that there were some hanging  issues under high load, indicating that transactional stability is  important for the journal and the distributed mutex mechanism on the  file journal may have concurrency issues. I haven't verified this, but  looking at the behavior in JProfile points to this.</p>
<p>As I said, this test is with the standard classes, that manage their own  connections the DB, I am intending to look into using the sakai  datasource to open connections.... however some work may need to be done  since Jackrabbit appears to manage the connections actively, rather than  allocating 1 connection per request thread.</p>
