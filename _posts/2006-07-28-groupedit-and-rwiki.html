<p>Looks like there are others with the same off line Collaborative  document writing. If you took Sakai + RWiki and exposed its services as  web services, it would be a short step to integrating a full blown off  line Collaborative Document Writing environment.</p>
<p>You would need a client, but taking the RWiki Render engine, and  embedding it as an Eclipse Application would generate quite a nice cross  platform environment, not Wisiwig, but then for this type of work,  wisiwig sometimes gets in the way, just look at Wikipedia for positive  proof of what happens without when you sacrifice wisiwig for collaboration.</p>

<p>Just a thought.</p>
