What would be required to make Sakai maven 2 ? I'm only investigating to see what it would take, I'm not advocating that this should be done.

Build targets. jar - no problem war - no problem component war - probably Ok

Deployment targets jar - shared, component, no idea at the moment war - probably Ok component was - no idea at the moment

But, Im going to have a look to see how hard it could be.
