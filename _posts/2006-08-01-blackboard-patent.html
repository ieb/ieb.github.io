<p>It doesn't come as any surprise that Blackboard has a number of patents.  Some of the them granted in places like Australia, NZ, and US and some  pending in the EU and other places.</p>
<p>They have also declared their intent to pursue these patents by filling  against Desire2Learn, so they are going to attack their competitors,  soft targets in supportive jurisdictions first.  Lets hope that in  countries outside the US, these patents will be seen as software patents  and not be granted. I think that in the UK at least, most patents have  to show that there is no prior art and that the patent is not a pure  implementation patent of a pre-existing invention.</p>
<p>Some European Universities go back to the 1400's or earlier, and some  were doing distance learning back in the 1960's, so perhaps that counts  as prior art? There are certainly a number examples of Online Course  management systems (CMS) in the US prior to the claims, and the roles of  Administrator, TA, Instructor and Student have existed in most  Universities for a few decades. I can only assume that those who granted  these Patents did not see any of this as relevant, granting and leaving  the arguments to court?</p>
<p>If granted, will Blackboard file against Open Source communities ? Will  they file against their customers who happen to use or develop Open  Source ? If they are granted their patents in many countries and they  aggressively execute them, we may see the end of software development  for educational purposes in Higher Education, except,Blackboard building  blocks.... but then lets not worry to much, Blackboard has been known to  make IPR claims on Building Blocks developed by their customers....  perhaps they should do all the "thought leading research" for us in the  future, anyway, who cares about innovation in higher ed, clearly not the  patent offices or anyone who thinks that pure Software Patents are  defensible.</p>
<p>The problem for Blackboard may be that most Open source communities  don't  have any commercial model, and don't have a single point of  focus, so Blackboard might have to file against each University or  individual developer in turn.</p>
<p>And what will happen to all research environments, or Web based  communities, are they also in Blackboards sights?</p>
<p>Dont get me wrong, I'm not against Patents, just ones that try an claim  innovation and invention where implementation is closer to the truth.</p>
