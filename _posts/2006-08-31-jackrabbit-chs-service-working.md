Its working... unbelievable :) Hats of to Apache Jackrabbit as it looks stable and easy to work with. Also the Existing Sakai CHS code is quite solid as I've mostly done cut and past and only found one or 2 places where abstract dependencies cross the API boundaries.

Next task is to see if the original Sakai DAV servlet will work with the new CHS. Resource tool does, but I expect there is tighter binding in that area.
