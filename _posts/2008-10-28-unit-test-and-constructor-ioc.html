<p>I might have said it before but, Constructor IoC has 2 big advantages over setter and getters.</p>
<ol>
<li>The IoC all happens in one shot, so there are no issues about a class being half configured, its always thread safe from the start.</li>
<li>When doing writing Unit tests is really clear what is needed to make a class function</li>
<li>Less code.</li>
</ol>
<p>That was 3... oops... bloat :)</p>
