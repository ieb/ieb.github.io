<p>Second in the slow network performance of a backup drive series, yes I cant run unit tests fast enough at the moment, so I am trying to speed my box up and fix all of those things that are broken. </p>
<p>Spotlight. </p>
<p>Who ever said building a search index was cheap. Its not, Spotlight does impact disk performance especially of mounted drives, especially network mounted drives. </p>
<p>Its possible to disable, while running, </p>
<pre>mdutil -i off /Volumes/ieb_remote</pre>
<p>and then to delete the contents of the index on that drive.</p>
<pre>mdutil -E /Volumes/ieb_remote</pre>
<p>and to see the status of indexing on the drive</p>
<pre>mdutil -s /Volumes/ieb_remote</pre>
