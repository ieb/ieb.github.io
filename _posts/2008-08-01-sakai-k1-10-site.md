I have published a maven site of the latest snaphot of the kernel containing current javadoc and test reports. Including some extremely embarrassing code coverage. (fixable). eg

<http://www.tfd.co.uk/kernel/sakai-kernel-impl/cobertura/index.html>

However this is coverage without integration tests.

The base of the site is at <http://www.tfd.co.uk/kernel>

Please dont take any notice of the checkstyle reports as they have not been configured.
