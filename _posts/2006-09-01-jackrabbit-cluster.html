<p>There is one think that I must have forgotten to check out completely  with Jackrabbit..... clustering ! Although it uses a DB, and has a Persistence Manager, there is a Cache  sitting above the Persistence Manager, which, in a cluster risks  becoming invalidated. There is work in this area under  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JCR-169 but no indication of when  its going to be implemented. I have also seen a jackrabbit-dev  discussion on the implementation of cache concurrency in a cluster,  which appears to be sensible and almost working.</p>
<p>So, although this looks promising, the only way to run Jackrabbit in a  cluster with the cache turned on is to have a single JCR node. This is  not ideal as I already know that the CHS API hits the underlying storage  very hard. Turning the cache off, is probably as bad as running it on a  single node.</p>
<p>There are a whole load of issues to be solve in this area if Jackrabbit  is to work in a cluster as we would like it to.</p>
