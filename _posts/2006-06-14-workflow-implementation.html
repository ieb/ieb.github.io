<p>I've resurrected the Workflow implementation that was started at the end  of the last JISC VRE project meeting. Wonderful how meetings give you  time to think, but leaving it alone for such a long time has done two  things. Help me forget what I was doing, and solve the same problems in  a different but better way.</p>
<p>The workflow engine is a light weight, in memory engine that has built  in transactions and rolls back on failure of any of the activities.  Hence in a discrete section of flow it either reaches a steady state or  it rolls all the way back to the starting point. The whole operation is  contained within a thread and storage transaction manager, this means  that the execution engine can explore all the pathways, evaluating or  executing all the tasks. Unlike a lamda-calculus approach (XLang, BPML)  this avoids the pre determination of an execution route through the  discrete segment of workflow. In fact, its rather simple and mirrors  some of the execution processes of a multi-threaded CPU. It has an  execution stack that winds up and down as the flow pointer traverses the  flow pathways. If all goes wrong before the final commit, the storage  transaction is rolled back, any XA compliant transaction mangers that  took part in the workflow segment are notified and the flow stack, and  flow modifications are thrown away leaving the workflow state in the  same state as it was before the operation started.</p>
<p>As with other transaction managers, the flow state is attached to the  thread and only committed once all is ready to commit. If you think of  this in DB terms, this would be characterized as READ_COMMITED. It  should also be possible to create SERIALIZABLE mode by synchronizing  blocks of the flow.</p>
<p>The one area to watch in this approach is the Business Process Objects  (BPO's) that hand of responsibility to no XA compliant components, must  ensure that, either the transaction flow passes synchronously into the  component, only returning ready for commit when the component is able to  do so, or when the component is able to take full responsibility. State  modifications that go outside the scope of the transaction cannot be  rolled back. An I don't fancy implementing a 'whoaa there, give me my  data back, I need to make a change' protocol.</p>
