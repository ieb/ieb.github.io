You cant, well not on OSX. But you can bring up a Parallels desktop, install debian etch from the network iso make certain you give it 1G of swap to keep oracle happy, dont add any extra packages and then edit /etc/apt/sources.list</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
deb http://debian.virginmedia.com/ etch contrib main

deb http://security.debian.org/ etch/updates main contrib
deb-src http://security.debian.org/ etch/updates main contrib

deb http://oss.oracle.com/debian unstable main non-free
</pre>
<p>
to include the oracle oss</p>
<p>
then you do a</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
wget http://oss.oracle.com/el4/RPM-GPG-KEY-oracle  -O- | sudo apt-key add -
apt-get update
apt-get install oracle-xe
</pre>
<p>
Once that is all done, and you have been through the oracle db configure step, you should apt-get install ssh   so that you can create a TCP tunnel to localhost:8080 from you OSX box. That done you can expose the http://localhost:8080/apex url on your OSX box, login to the Oracle XE web interface and configure.</p>
<p>
The nice thing about this is, if you keep the kernel small, its almost like running oracle as a native app in OSX. I did try with Ubuntu, but it was far to clever and made a huge mess of the VGA console and would only run with X enabled.... not very lightweight.</p>
