<p>The first weeks of a marriage are bliss, and I guess thats what the first hours of using yet another ORM tool is like. And so far, 4 hours in I'm having real fun (sad) with Apache Cayenne. I have a largish schema, not related to Sakai that I need to map, about 80 entities, mostly legacy with some reasonably complex relationships. The Cayenne Modeler tool and its integration with Eclipse is excellent, as is their getting started documentation.</p>
<p>After 30 minutes I had the whole schema mapped and building in Eclipse.</p>
<p>After 90 minutes after some problems with Spring XML (not related) the DataContext is up and running and I am able to navigate existing object.</p>
<p>Didn't even have to write a finder or any ORM code at this point.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the database I am working with has no relationships recorded in the DB, but the modeler is letting me do this and once the relationships are marked when I add the mappings into the classes it knows which ones to use, it understands reverse navigation. At the moment it just looks like it works.</p>
<p>I am bound to hit problems at some point, but the first impression is nothing like it was with Hibernate2 and Spring, 4 hours of hard work followed by a trip to the bookshop.</p>
<p>Although there isn't an obvious spring integration, it looks modular and will probably integrate with no problems. It might need a bit of configuration around the DataSource, but it looks like its not nearly as picky about being in Sakai Shared and will share a connection. So far its working so well, I haven't had to look too far inside to work that one out.</p>
<p>No wonder it popped up as a top level project at Apache so fast.</p>
