<p>With all that money swimming around in Google they cant help but hire  lots of programmers and let the experiment. Recent examples  http://tools.google.com/gapminder/ which lets you correlate CO2 tomes  per capita to life expectancy and play how it changed over the years.  (actually this is flash and it was bought by Google, but it wont be log  before it becomes Javascript+HTML+Canvas) and then there is a Canvas  emulator to poor old IE browsers  http://code.google.com/p/explorercanvas/ but the UI that makes you blink  continues to be  http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.edit?_id=0mwRk4O72xGtSjMVl7okhQ just  right click to see if you can find any flash..... there isn't any!  Java2D for Javascript</p>
