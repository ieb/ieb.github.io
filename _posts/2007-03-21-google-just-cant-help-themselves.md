With all that money swimming around in Google they cant help but hire lots of programmers and let the experiment. Recent examples http://tools.google.com/gapminder/ which lets you correlate CO2 tomes per capita to life expectancy and play how it changed over the years. (actually this is flash and it was bought by Google, but it wont be log before it becomes Javascript+HTML+Canvas) and then there is a Canvas emulator to poor old IE browsers http://code.google.com/p/explorercanvas/ but the UI that makes you blink continues to be http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.edit?_id=0mwRk4O72xGtSjMVl7okhQ just right click to see if you can find any flash..... there isn't any! Java2D for Javascript
