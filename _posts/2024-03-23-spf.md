Looks a lot like Google has started to enforce https://blog.google/products/gmail/gmail-security-authentication-spam-protection/  This is a graph of forwarded vs rejected email for a small domain I use CLoudFlare to forward to gmail accounts. Normally rejection rates are very low. Last week they started to rise.

The rejected messages typically miss SPF or DKIM header. In the case of large senders both are required. Seems like its not only catching the spammers but a lot of email lists and shopping sites are now unable to get messages or confirmation of orders through.... so make sure you screenshot that purchase and dont rely on getting an email confirmation. Nice one google, your training those that use gmail to not use if for real email uses.
