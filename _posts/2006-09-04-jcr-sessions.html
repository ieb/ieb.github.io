<p>I had thought with the structure of JCR that it would be a good ideal to  open and attach one session to each request thread, avoiding the session  creation mechanism. Before you think that this is totally daft, remember  that the JCR persistence manager in Jackrabbit manages persistence for  the entire JVM. So a managed session attached to the request thread is  not so dumb.... well, perhaps, except that if anything goes wrong with  the session, that state persists with the session to the next request.  The interesting bit is that the error hangs around until and eden GC  collection cycle takes place.... at which point any objects that were  left uncommitted in in the session are finalized. If the finalization  'rollsback' the JCR object transaction, the session recovers, but a it  looks like everything that was 'committed' after the error state is also  rolled back.</p>
<p>In retrospect, creating sessions per request is going to be a better  approach. However, its going to need some sort of hook into the request  cycle to ensure that the Session is created and destroyed. Lazy  construction is ok, but there is no unbind hook at the component level.</p>
