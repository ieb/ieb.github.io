<p>If you can get an SSH connection, into a network then you can forward IP  over an SSH tunnel.... we all knew that... but Apple Remote Desktop  works quite well tunneled. The port to forward in 5900, if you bring it  into you local host then you can connect with ARD to localhot and  control the remote one.</p>
<p>It would be better if all commands worked on the command line, but when  install manuals start talking about GUI admin my heart sinks. the ssh  forward command is ssh -L5900:remote-target-ip:5900 ssh.host.com  and  then connect with ARD onto the local host.  This only works for Control  and share... bit its quite fast (faster then VNC)</p>
