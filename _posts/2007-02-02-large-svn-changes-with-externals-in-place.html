<p>If you need to make changes to a large source tree with an .externals  defining the source tree, (like sakai) it can be a pain, so its better  to do it with a script perhapse.</p>
<p>for i in `find . -name m2-target` ; do pushd `dirname $i`; echo  m2-target &gt; svnsettarget; svn propget svn:ignore | grep -v m2-target &gt;&gt;  svnsettarget; cat svnsettarget; svn propset svn:ignore -F svnsettarget .  ; rm svnsettarget;  popd; done</p>
<p>followed by</p>
<p>for i in `ls -l | grep "^d" | cut -c45-`; do pushd $i; svn commit -m  'Adding ignore for m2-target'; popd; done</p>
<p> Will add to and commit changes to svn:ignore.</p>
