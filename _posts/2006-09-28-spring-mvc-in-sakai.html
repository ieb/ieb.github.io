<p>There is an unfortunate side effect of using Spring MVC based apps in  Sakai. Sakai has the Springframework libraries in shared, it also has a  number of utility classes that make spring MVC much easier, but if those  classes are expected to load the selecte view technology, that view  technology must also be placed in the shared classloader. As it stands,  you cant use the Spring provided VelocityViewResolver as it will pull  the Velocity jars into the shared classloader, and break every Velocity  app in Sakai.... but you can write your own view resolver which will sit  in your own webapp classloader.</p>
