<p>The penny dropped, I went to Inverness to meet the Tetra/Boddington  crowd from UHI and the similarities and differences between  Tetra/Boddington and Sakai became clear. They are both collaborative  environments for education and research, but Boddington has a  hierarchical organization where Sakai has a flat organizational  structure. If you add a Hierarchy super structure to organize Sakai  Sites and Entities and a mechanism of viewing that structure then Sakai  starts to look a lot like Boddington.</p>
<p>Boddingtons architecture is interesting. Being from the mid 1990's, the  inter webapp context capabilities of Tomcat and other containers was not  fully understood, so Boddington deploys in a single War and single  classloader. This appears to have 2 results, development is centralized  and the separation of concerns within the architecture is blurred. It  started life before JSP's and XML were around, so it has an interesting  templating language which is concise with a a short request stack, but  not that sophisticated. There is nothing wrong with this, but it does  add constraints to the development process.</p>
<p>If we add an organizational hierarchy to Sakai so that Tetra can use  parts of the Sakai framework to organize its tools and sites then most  of the knowledge and IP developed since the mid 1990's can be ported to  a more modern services oriented architecture, eventually are real SOA's  appear (eg Apache Tuscany), then Tetra can start to fulfill some of the  JISC ELF dreams of a loosely coupled SOA Web services architecture.</p>
