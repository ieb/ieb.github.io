<p>I've written a Data source based Sesame driver, but one thing that  occurs to me in the Sakai environment. Most production deployments do  not allow the application servers to perform DDL operations on the  database. Looking at the default implementations, thats the non data  source ones, they all perform lots of DDL on the database in startup and  in operation. This could be problem for embedding Sesame inside Sakai. I  think I am going to have to re-implement from scratch the schema  generation model. It might even be worth using Hibernate to build the  schema although it not going to make sense to use Hibernate to derive  the object model, the queries are just too complex and optimized.</p>
