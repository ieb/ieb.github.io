<p>Sesame is LGPL license, with a clarification on Java binding. The net  result of the statement in the Readme is that you can use Sesame in  another project without it having to be LGPL. Thats great! Well its  great if you want to use the LGPL Library in a way the developers  intended. When it comes to reimplementing an underlying diver you are  faced with three choices. Either implement the driver so that its  compatible with the internal implementation, or implement your own  algorithm, or use something else.</p>
<p>Implementing your own driver, keeping it compatible with the original  driver and underlying storage structure is almost certainly an LGPL  extension that should also be licensed as LGPL and released back to the net.</p>
<p>Implementing your own driver with its own algorithm will probably give  you the right to claim that the code is just using the LGPL code as a  library. Then you can choose you own license.</p>
<p>If your project already has a non xGPL license, then neither of the  above options are palatable. A fork in the 'virtual' code base or  changing your license. I dont know the answer, so I'm choosing the do  nothing option. I wont be using the Data source and non DDL based Sesame  RDBMS driver or fixing any of the bugs in it, since its just too close  to the original, uses too many of the thoughts and would have to be  licensed LGPL. So Sesame will be available inside Sakai search as a add  in module that uses its own database connection. I guess that not many  will want to use this non-standard, in the terms of Sakai, connection  strategy.</p>
<p>There is hope, if an RDF Triple store becomes as widespread and  acceptable as a RDBMS, then we will be able to treat it just like MySQL  or any other database. Time will tell.</p>
