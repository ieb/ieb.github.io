<p>The Segment merge algorithm in search is dumb and needs to be made  better. It has a habit of not merging upto the full 2G segment size at  the moment and needs to be made better. This has the advantage that we  don't ask for massive transfers, but it would be better to be able to  ask for a target segment size and actually get it.</p>
