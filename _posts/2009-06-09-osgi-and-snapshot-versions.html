<p>If you call your versions 1.2.0-SNAPSHOT and reference them as such in a manifest file, they wont load in OSGi, or at least with Felix, as the versions are expected to be numbers, parsed on . In the Manifest the version must be parsable, 1.2.0.SNAPSHOT, which looks a bit odd, but works. It looks like the bnd tool does this for you.</p>
