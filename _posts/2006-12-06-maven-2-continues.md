So, During listening to the "reassurances" of the Blackboard atourney that the wouldn't issue writs against opensource before tea time......:)... I tried to do a bit of innovation. The maven 2 conversion for the build structure is starting to work. One thing that I notice is that the dependency definition is much more precise in maven2 which is generating missing deps in some of the projects (xercese et al).

The other thing, on my slow G4, that is nice, is mvn2 is \*much\* faster!
