<p>Search is all inside Jackrabbit inside K2, there is no search service and no managing segments. It supports all standard documents that you might encounter, and the lag between update and search is generally &lt; 100ms. This is not really any surpriseÂ  since the Query mechanism inside Jackrabbit depends on search. This means we can do relational queries using the search engine without hitting the DB at all.... just a bit more scalable.</p>
