<p>Jackrabbit has created a clustered version... or at least there is a  version in trunk that will be part of core that clusters. Jackrabbit can  be made to use a shared DB quite easily, but if you do that and have 2  or more nodes accessing, the local cache maintains a stale copy of the  data. The cache is what makes Jackrabbit fast. You could throw away the  cache or make it write through expire, but that would kill much of the  performance.</p>
<p>So the clustered Jackrabbit uses a file based Journal to record the  changes, nodes reading that file can then invalidate their local cache  based on the shared file. This has two drawbacks, firstly its slow as  polling has to be used, and secondly its not scalable as only one can  write at a time.</p>
<p>I dont know if its possible, but I would hope we could replace this  filesystem journal with ActiveMQ and a JMS topic. All JCR nodes could  subscribe to the Topic and invalidate the local cache based on JMS messages.</p>
