In general the Wiki tool was well received, and the presentations done by Harriet, Andrew and Frances Tracy invoked thought. It was especially good to see faculty members relaying real teaching and research experience of Sakai in use.

However, we still have lots questions about how sections/groups are going to relate to Wiki sub-sites. The mapping idea, where a wiki sub-site maps to a section/realm group appears to make sense, but the UI for controlling the permissions and the way in which roles might be added to realms just isn't clear enough yet. I hope to see this in in 2.2, but it might slip.
