<p>I have published a maven site of the latest snaphot of the kernel containing current javadoc and test reports. Including some extremely embarrassing code coverage. (fixable). eg</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tfd.co.uk/kernel/sakai-kernel-impl/cobertura/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.tfd.co.uk/kernel/sakai-kernel-impl/cobertura/index.html</a></p>
<p>However this is coverage without integration tests.</p>
<p>The base of the site is at <a href="http://www.tfd.co.uk/kernel" target="_blank">http://www.tfd.co.uk/kernel</a></p>
<p>Please dont take any notice of the checkstyle reports as they have not been configured.</p>
<p> </p>
