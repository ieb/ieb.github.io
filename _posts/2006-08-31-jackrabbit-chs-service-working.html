<p>Its working... unbelievable :) Hats of to Apache Jackrabbit as it looks  stable and easy to work with. Also the Existing Sakai CHS code is quite  solid as I've mostly done cut and past and only found one or 2 places  where abstract dependencies cross the API boundaries.</p>
<p>Next task is to see if the original Sakai DAV servlet will work with the  new CHS. Resource tool does, but I expect there is tighter binding in  that area.</p>
