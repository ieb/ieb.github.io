<p>There are some interesting things that happen when you try and configure  Jackrabbit. Firstly, the configuration appears to be stored in the  repository home, so, once created, changing the startup configuration  probably wont change the repository.... except that some settings appear  to get through.  For instance, the driver class and the database url  appear to get through, but the username and password dont. Im not  certain what exactly is happening.</p>
<p>The other strangeness, is that the standard SinpleDbPersistanceManager  uses a DirectManager.getConnection(url,usename,password) to get the  connection to the database. I haven't found out (yet) if there is one  persistence manager per JVM, or its one per session.</p>
<p>If its one per JVM, its probably Ok, one per session, is not so good, as    this will require pooling or opening and closing of sessions. For the  moment, I've implemented a version (almost exact copy) of the jackrabbit  SimpleDbPersistanceManager that looks the datasource up from Spring, and  uses that.</p>
<p>The weird bit about JackRabbit in a spring environment, is that is uses  its own IoC quite separate from Spring. Im not entirely certain how this  is all going to work in a cluster, but it looks like it might require  some shared disk to work. I hope not, the documentation appears to say  its Cluster friendly, but I can see some Lucene segments on local disk  which doesn't look cluster like.</p>
