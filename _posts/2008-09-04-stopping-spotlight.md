Second in the slow network performance of a backup drive series, yes I cant run unit tests fast enough at the moment, so I am trying to speed my box up and fix all of those things that are broken.

Spotlight.

Who ever said building a search index was cheap. Its not, Spotlight does impact disk performance especially of mounted drives, especially network mounted drives.

Its possible to disable, while running,

```
mdutil -i off /Volumes/ieb_remote
```

and then to delete the contents of the index on that drive.

```
mdutil -EÂ /Volumes/ieb_remote
```

and to see the status of indexing on the drive

```
mdutil -s /Volumes/ieb_remote
```
