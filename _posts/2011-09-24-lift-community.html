<p>I have been looking for a way to create RESTfull services quickly and simply. JAX-RS is one way, but in my search I wandered in the world of Scala and came across the Lift community. Not exactly a perfect RESTfull framework, but their "<a href="http://www.assembla.com/spaces/liftweb/wiki/Expected_Behavior_in_the_Lift_community">Expected Behavior in the Lift community</a>" is well worth a read before you post (or reply) with (or to) frustration on list. I certainly have shared many of the same thoughts with the author, David Pollak,Â  from time to time, and I suspect at times with shame that I have not always lived by the rules he so clearly expresses. Its one more link on my bookmark list titled "To Reflect on what I do, regularly".</p>
