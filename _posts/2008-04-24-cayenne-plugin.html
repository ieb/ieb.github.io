<p>
I have been playing with Shindig to create a datamodel to go behind the OpenSocial API. At first I thought it would be simple to use JDBC direct, but it turns out that the model has a reasonable number of dependencies and the entities are quite big. So, I decided to use Cayenne. The model is created and has some simple test cases, and it all appears to work. I did write a maven plugin to generate SQL scripts from the Cayenne model, so its supports about most major databases (about 8). Creating the model from some Java interfaces was quite easy, infact I did most of it by converting the java class into cayenne XML.</p>
<p>
The SQL that this generates at runtime, when querying etc appears much cleaner than Hibernate.... from a DBA point of view.</p>
