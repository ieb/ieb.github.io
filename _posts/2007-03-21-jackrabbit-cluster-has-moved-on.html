<p>It looks like Jackrabbit clustering has move on quite a bit since I last  bought a JCR up. Originally there was a demand for clustering in  http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JCR-169 and later that was  implemented under http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JCR-623. The  basic mechanism is to maintain a journal log that all nodes in the  cluster subscribe to and replay to remain consistent within the cluster.  The replay causes the the nodes in the cluster to maintain their cache  consistent with other nodes in the cluster. The transport mechanism of  the cluster was originally file system but could be anything  http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/jackrabbit-dev/200611.mbox/%3c66c10f230611100158u70ff7b9ak59b889b86b409215@mail.gmail.com%3e</p>
<p>Now in 1.2.3 there is a database backed journal log. Which would make it  really easy to implement a JCR cluster.... but perhaps an embedded JCR  isnt the way to go as it has a clean RMI interface that will/should be  able to connect to any 170 implementation. Offloading all of the content  storage to a content storage cluster, separate fro Sakai has some  attractions, not least because the API is clean and at a complexity  narrow point, leading to network efficiency. Similarly, using the  Jackrabbit RMI libraries to connect to a suitably configured JCR server  will enable vendors and institutions to plug in a JCR server underneath  Sakai without changing Sakai code.... just like Oracle or MySQL.</p>
<p>The other positive, is performance, Jackrabbit appears to be even  faster, 380MB in 8,101 files was reporting and ETA of 5 minutes over  WebDav to localhost on an OSX box. I wont tell you what the equivalent  currently is for Sakai, try for yourself :)</p>
