<p>A few months ago, Caret offered hosting space to Darwin online a  Cambridge University Project. We didnt write any of the code, that work  was done by Antranig Basman who works at Caret part time.</p>
<p>This Wednesday we found out that the BBC was interested in interviewing  the project lead, which they did. On Thursday morning the site went  live. The BBC broadcast items on Breakfast Radio and TV news and a  number other channels and within 4 hours we had seen 2M hits on the  site. At then end of the day I think we saw 4M hits and today, Friday, I  think there have been another 4M hits. This probably is that big a site,  but we were expecting about 500,000 hits in the first day, so there was  quite a bit of on the fly load testing as it ramped up. Credits must go  to Daniel Parry and Sultan Kus for tuning the deployment on the fly and    monitoring the infrastructure and for Antranig, for developing  something that didn't crash in the first few hours.</p>
<p>What we learn't..... 80% of the visit started from people typing in the URL, not from search  engines or referrers, 10% were from slashdot.... traditional media  channels are alive and well, at least in the Uk.</p>
<p>We should have load tested a bit harder and deployed on hardware matched  to the load.... we should have predicted the load better as well.</p>
<p>Its much easier to load an application up with a few 100,000 users all  wanting to get to the information, than it is to use a load tester....  everyone a few 100,000 willing users, don't they.</p>
