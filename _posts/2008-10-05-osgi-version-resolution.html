<p>OSGi version resolution looks great, but there is a problem that I am encountering. I can deploy more than one version of a jar as seperate OSGi bundles, but unless the consuming bundle was explicity written to specify a range of versions that bundle will not start.</p>
<p>Bundle A was built with a dependency on package org.apache.commons.useful;version=1.0.2, which means any version &gt; 1.0.2.</p>
<p>I deploy bundle B with org.apache.commons.useful version 1.0.4, great no problem.</p>
<p>Bundle C depends on org.apache.commons.usefull;version=1.0.8,</p>
<p>So I deploy bundle D with 1.0.8, great for Bundle C, but now Bundle A can see 1.0.4 and 1.0.8 and wont start, due to a constraint violation.(at least in Felix).</p>
<p>To make this work I have to go back to bundle A, and rebuild it with version="[1.0.2,1.0.8)" meaning "I depend on any version &gt;= 1.0.2 and &lt; 1.0.8|. Thats all fine, but, now every time I add a second version of a jar to OSGi, I have to go back and repackage all the bundles that dont have precise enough version numbers.</p>
<p>You might argue 1.0.4 and 1.0.8 are equivalent so dont deploy bundle B anymore, but the same problem happens when you try and deploy bundles container 2.0.6 and 2.5.5 when 2.5.5 is not fully backwards compatable.</p>
<p>Worse, this also means if I took any 3rd party bundles without precise version ranges, I will have to work out how to rebuild them. Not exactly and inviting task when you have &gt; 100 bundles in a container. Makes me wonder if its worth all the hassle.</p>
