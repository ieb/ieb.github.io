<p>New feature for search, Tagged words of the search terms in a search results.</p>
<p>1. Take all the term vectors from Documents in a search result. 2. Merge the term vectors. 3. Take the top 100 4. Sort alphabetically. 5. CSS format the word sizes using a normalized frequency 6. Output the results.</p>
<p> The only problem that I can see at the moment, is that the Stemming  algorithm (look and looking are equivalent terms) used means that terms  can look a little odd. There probably isnt a way to un-stem. :(</p>
