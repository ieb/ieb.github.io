With the excelence of Firefox many developers leave out Safari from their list of primary targeted browsers. I think this is beginning to be a mistake.

- The standards compliance of Safari is good, and gives devlopers a second browser platform with good compliance
- You thought Safari had got fast in v3.0, but it just got faster again, SquirelFish the core Javascript engine of WebKit just got 1.6 times faster than the version in v3.0 of Safari. see <http://webkit.org/blog/189/announcing-squirrelfish/>
- iPhone and Google Android is using WebKit behind the browser, so if it works on Safari it will more than likely work on iPhone, iTouch and any other mobile running Google Android in the future
