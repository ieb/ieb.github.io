<p>So the CHS based on Jackrabbit is largely written and working. It can be  found in Sakai contrib  (https://source.sakaiproject.org/contrib/tfd/trunk). Surprisingly it  works! After a few hiccups with node types and getting the Sakai  representation of additional properties into the JCR node structure, it  all works. I think I've only had to fix about 3 bugs so far, mainly  where /'s were not put into Id's.</p>
<p>It does need more testing and there are some startup issues to be  sorted, as Im only running against HSQLDB at the moment. I'd also like  to see if we cant get the Jackrabbit DAV Servlet working as Sakai  DAV.... there are some concerns about compliance with this.</p>
