<p>Well I thought Vectors were synchronized. The Object is, but Iterators  are not.</p>
<p> From the Java Doc</p>
<p>" The Iterators returned by Vector's iterator and listIterator methods are  fail-fast: if the Vector is structurally modified at any time after the  Iterator is created, in any way except through the Iterator's own remove  or add methods, the Iterator will throw a  ConcurrentModificationException. Thus, in the face of concurrent  modification, the Iterator fails quickly and cleanly, rather than  risking arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior at an undetermined time in  the future. The Enumerations returned by Vector's elements method are  not  fail-fast. "</p>
<p> Hence, create an iterator on a vector and you will get a  ConcurrentModificationException on the iterator if the vector is  modified, even though the Vector itself is Synchronized.</p>
