I have spent most of the Day playing with Shindig, integrating its data-model into Sakai and learning Guice, which is very nice and simple, especially its error feedback, which just seams to get straight to the problem.

While doing this, on and off I have written a page on [Widget Accessibility](http://bugs.sakaiproject.org/confluence/display/MYSAK/Widget+Accessibility) more because I have been struggling to understand what we really need to do, and want someone to tell me what's wrong. If you are reading this, and you know all about ARIA and how to write accessible web applications, please tell me what not to do.... but please keep it simple so I can understand what you are talking about.
