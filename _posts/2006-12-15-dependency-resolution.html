<p>Maven 2 dependency resolution is a wonderful thing, but its not quite  there in 2 when you have multiple classloaders and dont necessarily want  the transitive dependencies to flow through. In sakai in Maven 1 we  defined everything explicitly, but in maven 2 I find that jars in the  shared classloader creep into the components packaging and and webapp  packaging. The only way to stop this is to make the jar provided, but if  that is done the dependency does not flow, so you cant make a dependency  transitive up to a war file and then not pack it. Its all or nothing,  provided or not and packed.</p>
<p>The solution, as in maven 1 appears to be explicit which eliminates one  of the nicest features of maven 2.... however there is a sting in the  tail to all of this. There are many 3rd party components that we use in  sakai, that we bundle into wars. These have transitive dependencies that  we are already providing for in shared, hence the only way to prevent  packing is to explicitly re scope the dependency as provided... bloating  the pom and increasing the overhead... just the thing maven 2 was  supposed to help with. Looking at the maven jira, much of this will be  fixed in 2.2 .</p>
