There has been a slow stream of bugs coming from Cape Town with search. It shows that its being used in anger which is good, but it also shows that there want enough testing in QA and my own approach to testing wasnt 100%. But thats not untypical of a developer who doesnt think up every type of user input.

All the bugs are logged in Jira and most of them have been trivial to fix, a couple of lines of code.
