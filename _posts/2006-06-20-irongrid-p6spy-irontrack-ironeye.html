<p>Picking up an old Hibernate book, flicking to the back, I noticed  IronTrack. I remember this from back in 2003, but never used it. When  you start searching for IronGrid in Google, it looks like they don't  exist any more, a pity since it looked like a good way of seeing what a  DB was doing. There are commercial products that do the same, but this  was supposed to be OpenSource. However their is talk of a Trial License,  which a new model to me, open source, but if you want the binaries, you  need a license, strange. Perhaps thats why they don't exist any more.</p>
<p>However, there is a Sourceforge project, with 2 developers, no released  files and no activity and no stated license. Digging a little deeper,  the code is in CVS. It appears to be Apache 1.1 licensed, and the  Licensing code has been commented out. For posterity, I've built the  jars and uploaded <a href="/downloads/irongrid.bin.tgz">binaries</a> and <a href="/downloads/irongrid.src.tgz">source</a>. You can  run the binary with java -jar irontracksql.jar or java -jar ironeyesql.jar</p>
