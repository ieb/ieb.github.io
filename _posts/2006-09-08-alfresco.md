Looks like Alfresco is starting to pursue JSR-170 for its 1.2 release. The positive side is it clusters, the negative side is that at the moment it doesn't pass all the Level 2 170 tests. I could be plugged in under the new CHS service with a small adapter, but, if its not solid through the JSR-170 API, then it will be a pain to run, even in a cluster.

One to watch and put under the Content Hosting Service when its ready, if Jackrabbit doesn't get there first.
