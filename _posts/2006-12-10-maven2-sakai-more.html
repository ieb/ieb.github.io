<p>So I now have a set of poms for all apart from OSP that verify and go  through the build. The XSLT approach has been augmented by scripts and  manual editing to manipulate the poms into a structure that builds.</p>
<p>The Sakai build exposes some bugs in maven that have cause me to have to  change the structure of the way in which we define dependent or parent  projects. M2 will not reliably chain many masters together, so the  extend constructs found in gradebook, sections, osp and some jsf tools  have to be recast. The mechanism that appears to work is to make all  projects have a parent of the master/pom.xml and then pull the other  dependencies through as dependent poms, this works and gives good  control (as well as allowing multiple extends)</p>
<p>The next issues that hits us is that m2 has transient dependencies, all  of which get packed unless marked as provided, and that  includes the transients. So you have to mark all jars as provided that  are provided even in the impl poms otherwise they will pull shared or  common jars into component and webapp builds wich is wrong. Since we are  comming from M1, where re definend everything the solution here is to  make everything provided and use the explicit pack at the last stage  (which leads back to the shared and common issues before)</p>
<p>The other real killer that happens here is that M2 will inspect  transient deps from standard poms, for example struts has a burred dep  on jdbc_stdext, which we dont use has we are in a hibernate world... we  use  a h2.1.8 version of this, I dont know exactly why this is, but the  solution I have used is to modify the struts pom in the local repository  to depend on the correct one. Struts is used in samigo and since that is  heavilly hibernate this looks like the safe thing to do.</p>
<p>Another thing that is different about M2 is that it hides the deps that  appear in the classpath without you knowing it. For instance the xercese  dependencies appeared without you knowing it in M1. In M2 you have to  define them (as provided), so there are a number of poms (5-10) that  have had these deps added manually when the compile fails.</p>
<p>Finally,</p>
<p>Since we have used our own repository, I am finding that I need to  manually build the local repository for maven2 as deps cant be found.  This will need to be propagated to somewhere central and hosted by sakai.</p>
<p>Inspite of all that, M2 is much nicer to work with. For those  interested, I am keeping the plugin development at  https://source.sakaiproject.org/contrib/tfd/trunk/maven</p>
