<p>Vancouver 2006 was a watershed conference for me. The Sakai Foundation, less than 6 months old, transitioned from a funded project into and Open source community. Chuck was appointed as CEO, thankfully, as selecting almost anyone else would have created a year or more of pain for the community. Problems and issues were openly exposed and discussed without blame of recrimination. The future feels positive.</p>
