<p>What would be required to make Sakai maven 2 ? I'm only investigating to  see what it would take, I'm not advocating that this should be done.</p>
<p>Build targets. jar  - no problem war - no problem component war - probably Ok</p>
<p>Deployment targets jar - shared, component, no idea at the moment war - probably Ok component was - no idea at the moment</p>
<p>But, Im going to have a look to see how hard it could be.</p>
