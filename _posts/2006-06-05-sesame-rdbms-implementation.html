<p>It looks like there are some interesting features in the Sesame default  RDBMS implementation. Since it uses its own connection pooling, it tends  to commit on close. If the standard connection pool that is used by  default is replaced by a java.sql.Datasource, things like commit don't  happen when Sesame thinks they should have happened. The net result is a  bunch of exceptions associated with lock timeouts, as one connection  coming out of the data source block subsequent connection. The solution  looks like its going to be to re-implement most of the RDBMS layer with  one that is aware of a Datasource rather than a connection pool.</p>
