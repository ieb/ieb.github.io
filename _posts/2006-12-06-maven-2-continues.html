<p>So, During listening to the "reassurances" of the Blackboard atourney  that the wouldn't issue writs against opensource before tea  time......:)... I tried to do a bit of innovation. The maven 2  conversion for the build structure is starting to work. One thing that I  notice is that the dependency definition is much more precise in maven2  which is generating missing deps in some of the projects (xercese et al).</p>
<p>The other thing, on my slow G4, that is nice, is mvn2 is *much* faster!</p>
