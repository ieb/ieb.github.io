<p>Google are now analysing videos uploaded for Copyright infringement. If you happen to video cam recording of anything that has some ambient music, and publish that, even to one person, I am reliably informed that, if the music was copyrighted, by publishing you have breached the copyright. Do it too many times and Google will ban you.</p>
<p>I video cam'd my daughters school play that had some background music, from the Jungle Book, the video was banned since Disney owns the copyright. I breached the copyright by publishing to her grand-parents even though I made the video private on Google Video. I have since deleted the video from Google. The school is probably in breach of copyright by pressing play without explicit permission form Disney Corp when parents were listening.</p>
<p>I have a feeling the days are numbered when Google can take a relaxed attitude copyright infringement on YouTube and Google Video, will this be the start of a contraction of services?</p>
