<p>I'm having another go at implementing A JCR based service in Sakai, this  time I'm not binding it to CHS as I want to see if its possible to solve  the clustering issues with Jackrabbit 1.2.3. So far the structure looks  interesting, javax.jcr.* lives in shared and with a very small  additional API, used can get hold of a JCR session, which my be  authenticated as system, anon or a Sakai user. Once they have this they  can manipulate the repository using all the normal JCR/JSR-170 API  features.</p>
<p>The implementation is a Jackrabbit one, that uses a JAAS based Login  Manager and a Custom Secirity manager to connect to Sakai. I am allowing  as part of the public API users of the JCRService to rejuster  SecurityConverters that convert the pure JCR locks into more meaningful  Sakai locks and the pure JCR references into Sakai security realms. This  is an inject on init pattern as used by the Portal for its URLHandlers  and RenderService Impl.</p>
<p>The Hope is that, with some work it will be possible to run implement  other JCRServices using Harvest Road, Xythos, Alfresco or others and it  should be possible to bind to these over JCR-RMI allowing Sakai to use  an Institutional JCR. When we looked at this in the past the JCR inside  CHS had too many bindings that were going to make it hard work to use  other JCR's.</p>
<p>Naturally with the new Content Hosting Handler mechanism in CHS 2.4 it  will be possible to write a simple CHH bridge to the JCRService to allow  content to be hosted there, although I suspect some new test tools will  just bind direct as the JCR API is more powerful and feature rich.  Unfortunately its also more difficult to use, so I can see a  JCREasyService being created.</p>
<p>Not to write a bundle of Unit tests to stress the system. Perhapse I can  just re-user Jackrabbits own test suite with a suitable startup/teardown  combination... mocking the cover for UserDirectoryService is going to be  fun :)</p>
