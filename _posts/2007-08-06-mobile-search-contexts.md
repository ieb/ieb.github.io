Looks like the world outside Sakai is continuing to focus on search that has context. Taptu provides search results where the content is the sort of things that you actually want on a mobile phone.... not just the entire web recoded for a mobile phone. I understand that they are using Lucene and Velocity, and from the looks of it are buying lots of disk for the indexes. I wouldn't expect a Sakai instance to need a 750GB index, but it looks like Taptu are already up at 10x that. See [http://www.taptu.com/blog/](http://www.taptu.com/blog/ "Taptu Blog") for the blog ... which also looks obsessed and well informed on/with mobile devices.
