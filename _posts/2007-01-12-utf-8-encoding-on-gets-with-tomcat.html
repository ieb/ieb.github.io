<p>Looks like browsers dont UTF encode Gets correctly, or at least that  whats observed. Take a form, make it a GET and put some UTF-chars in ...  eg 中国的网页</p>
<p>Then when it gets to the server ( in this case tomcat it comes out badly  coded).</p>
<p>If you change the GET to a POST, encoding works Ok. It could be a tomcat  issue assuming the get url is something it inst or it could be something  more fundamental. It looks like it happens even when the URL is URL  encoded.</p>
