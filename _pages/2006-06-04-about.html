<p>This blog is the personal blog of Ian Boston and not the views of my employer at the time of writing the post.</p>
<p>As of January 2013 I am a Senior Engineer with Adobe R&amp;D working on things related to Adobe Marketing Cloud.</p>
<p>Prior to January 2013 I was Chief Technology Officer for Digital Services at the University of Cambridge Library. I normally live in Cambridge, UK, but I am currently working remotely from Sydney Australia.</p>
<p>If you want to talk, the best way to get in contact is to email me at ... ieb at tfd dot co dot uk. Â tfd.co.uk is my Domain left over from my consultancy company, Timefields Ltd, which I closed when I moved to Australia. Its from a time (1990's) when all domain names were TLA's and I have grown rather fond of it.</p>
