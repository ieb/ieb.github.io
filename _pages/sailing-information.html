<p>Sailing Weekends, leaving Friday night or Saturday morning, sleeping overnight on board, returning Sunday tea time. For those that have never been, the Boat is Isador a Hallberg Rassy 38 (see <a href="http://www.hallberg-rassy.com/hr38/hr38.shtml">sister ship</a>) berthed at   <a href="http://www.eastcoastmarinas.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=12&amp;Itemid=31">Shotley Point Marina</a> . The distanced sailed will be crew experience and weather dependent.</p>
<p>You need to bring, sheet/pillow/duvet/sleeping bag. Some form of waterproof footwear, not Hobnail boots. You will need sunglasses and sun block and perhaps a hat. We will share food/drink costs everything else is on the house. I will be driving from Cambridge and have space for 4 in the car (including myself).</p>
<p>Places are limited, max 4 per weekend, and I cant go on all weekends only a selection.</p>
